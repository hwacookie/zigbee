### Pairing
Pair the sensor by pressing the pair button min. 10 seconds.
The red light on the front side should flash a few times and the turn off.
After a few seconds it turns back on and pulsate. When connected, the light turns off. 

If the above does not work for you, try pressing the pairing button 5 times in a row. After that, at least my device was in pairing mode.
### Reset
Reset the sensor by pressing the pair button 4 times in a row. Wait till the LED confirms it.
